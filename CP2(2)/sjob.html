        are intrinsic motivations.

    <h3 style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">1. Career as a Spanish Translation and Interpreter</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">
        Knowledge of Spanish can help you get the chance to become a translator, interpreter, editor, proofreader, and content
        writer.
        While there are many translation software like Google, Bing, etc., machine translation cannot replace human translation.
        There are words with dual meanings in different languages. Thus, what works in one tongue does not necessarily work in
        another.
        Human translators and interpreters are much more reliable and effective, and the ‘personal’ aspect will always beat
        technology.
