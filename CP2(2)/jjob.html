    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">
        Here are some job opportunities if you speak fluent japanese:-
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">1. TRANSLATION & INTERPRETATION</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">
        Translation and interpretation are some of the most famous career choices for people that speak Japanese.
        Now, you have to know this; translation is different from interpretation. That’s right!
        When working as a translator, your work will be to “take materials written in Japanese and convert them into English”
        and vice versa.
        On the other hand, working as an interpreter will mediate between two speakers of two different languages.
        Both of you MUST understand — and translating the two tongues to each of the parties involved.
        Many companies in the private and public sectors require these services.
        While you may get employed to work as a translator, the position demands that you work as both translator and
        interpreter. So have that in mind.
        The average salary for Japanese translators is quite lucrative.

    <h3 style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">2. JAPANESE TRAINER / TEACHING</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">
    Japanese are ridiculously shy when it comes to learning another man’s language. It is one reason why the majority of
    their companies in India are hunting for trainers.
    As a Japanese language speaker in India, you can apply to work as a trainer for any Japanese company to train potential
    candidates for an outstanding opportunity.
    Or maybe help train their staff on how to deal with clients and businesses from a different nature.
    Again, numerous job opportunities for language teachers in the educational sector offer a career for people who want to
    add value by teaching Japanese.
    When you take a teaching career, you will also help to sharpen your language skills and inspire future generations of
    Japanese speakers.
    Many schools and colleges, institutions, and corporate buildings/offices have openings for Japanese teachers in India.

    <h3 style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">3.EMBASSIES & GOVERNMENT JOBS</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">
        Indian Government entities like External Affairs Ministry, Indian Embassy in foreign countries, Ministry of Tourism, and
        other Ministries like Education, Commerce, Science & Technology, Agriculture, Textile require Japanese language experts.
        While the number of the opening is quite limited, if you are not a government employee, you will still grab a job
        opportunity with these government entities.
        When we say “Language Jobs in Embassies,” we refer to a supportive staff or officer posted in India or abroad to serve
        at embassies or consulates.
        Alternatively, you can work as a staff for the Japanese embassy in India.
        The second option is very much possible since most Japanese rarely learn another man’s language.
        Japanese-speaking diplomats do their jobs in embassies /consulates across Japan, meaning you should prepare to relocate.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">4. TRAVEL, HOSPITALITY & TOUR GUIDEt</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">Suppose you’re looking for careers involving languages and travel. In that case, the broad spectrum of travel, tourism,
    leisure, and hospitality industries is a great option.
    The hospitality industry is one huge area where you can look for career options in some events, establishments, travel
    companies, hotels, and many more.
    You can even decide to go solo and work as a tour guide.
    As we said earlier, the Japanese economy is mainly driven by export, and India is a major destination for Japanese goods
    and services.
    So, there has been a steady rise in the number of Japanese visiting India each year.
    You can function as a tour guide for Japanese tourists or a visiting group of students or researchers touring India for
    one or more reasons.
    Conversely, you can also work as a tour guide/consultant for Indian students or groups visiting Japan for one or more
    purposes.

    </p>
    <h3 style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">5.WORK AT A JAPANESE COMPANY</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">
    There are branches of Japanese MNCs doing business in India. You can become an employee of one of these companies.
    According to the Embassy of Japan and JETRO, the number of Japanese companies registered in India is 1,441. Japanese
    establishments are 5,102, as of October 2018.
    Depending on your primary skills, you can work in Japanese MNCs like Toshiba, Honda, Suzuki, Sony, Toyota, Canon,
    Yamaha, Panasonic, Mitsubishi, Casio, Daikin, Fujitsu, and more.
    The position on offer will also vary according to the company.
    The good thing is that once you have the primary qualification required for such jobs.
    For example, an engineering degree, an MSc in IT or MBA in finance, or a simple graduate for various assignments.
    Your Japanese fluency will put you far ahead of others who cannot speak the language but have better qualifications.
    You can also work for companies having a business relationship with Japanese MNCs in the automobile, engineering,
    information and technology, animation, or gaming sectors.
