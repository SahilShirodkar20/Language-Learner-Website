        huge selection of French reading materials, including novels, poems, and plays. Books can be searched according
        to title, genre, category, and author.

    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">1.Le Monde: A website to read daily news stories in
        French. Covering both local and international news, the site also features categories like culture, economy, and
        opinions. This is a really useful site if you’re looking to practice your reading comprehension within a
        real-life context.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">2.TV5Monde: The Langue Française section of the
        TV5Monde website is probably one of the best free resources to learn French. It’s divided into four sections:
        Découvrir (discover), Jouer (play), Apprendre (learn), and Enseigner (teach). These categories offer a ton of
        engaging french learning resources like videos, quizzes, practice exercises, and more. Everyone from beginners
        to advanced learners will find something here.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">3.InnerFrench: It contains podcasts and videos,
        innerFrench’s founder, Hugo, articulates clearly and speaks at a slightly slower than natural speed to ensure
        maximum comprehension and learning. He also speaks exclusively in French, including when he introduces new
        words, so that viewers can have the full immersion experience.
        His material addresses a variety of topics that focus on French culture and sometimes dabble in relationships
        and health.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">4.ITALKI: italki is the most flexible and affordable
        place to find a tutor for the language you’re learning. They have a huge number of teachers offering classes to
        students of over 100 different languages. As a learner, you’ll be able to find a tutor that best fits your
        learning style, schedule, and personality.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">5.NEWS IN SLOW FRENCH: News in Slow French offers
        three different levels of content (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) with lots of different features for
        each. I’m a huge fan of what’s included at the intermediate level but a bit less enthusiastic about the content
        at the beginner and advanced levels. That’s not to say those levels are bad, they aren’t by any means, but the
        material available for intermediate-level learners is really fantastic. Much more than simply current events
        narrated at a slower pace, News in Slow French is comprehensive, engaging, fun, and effective.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">3.Radio France</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">Head to the Radio France website and you’ll have
        your pick of real-world resources to beef up your listening skills. The website offers 24-hour news coverage,
