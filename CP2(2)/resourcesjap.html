    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">In this list below, some of the best resources to
        learn Japanese.</p>
    <h3 style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">1. Learn the Japanese alphabet</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">The best way to learn Japanese is to start with the basics: learning the alphabet. There are 3 basic writing systems you
    need to learn to be able to read Japanese: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">2. Practice grammar</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">How do you learn Japanese grammar? If you want to master it perfectly, you have to forget everything you know about
    English grammar as they differ dramatically. Unlike many of the romance languages, Japanese has only two tenses: past
    and non-past (present and future). However, there are two forms: polite and plain. The last one is used for casual
    speech.
    We recommend that you start to learn Japanese grammar with the help of textbooks. The best books to learn Japanese
    grammar are:
    <ul>
        <li>Practice Makes Perfect: Basic Japanese;</li>
        <li>A Guide to Japanese Grammar by Tae Kim;</li>
        <li>Japanese Hiragana & Katakana for Beginners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:20px;text-align:left;">It’s also important to mention that Japanese has an entirely different writing system: from right to left, from top to
        bottom. In these textbooks, you’ll find a lot of practical lessons that will help you get a sense of Japanese writing.</p>
